# **Lift Logix**
Lift Logix is a web application developed ober the course of 2 weeks. It is an app that helps regular gym goers to create workout programme, customize their exercise plan for each split, log weights and sets, receive weight/reps  and see charts for exercises progression.

## **Features**
During the two-week sprint, we were able to implement the following user stories:

- **Design workout programme**: Users can design their own workout programme, configuring the number of weeks and customizing exercise plan for each split.
- **Schedule or start their workout**: Users can start their workout on the go, or schedule a workout and visualize their completed and scheduled in a calendar.
- **Log weights and reps**: Users can log their weights and repetitions for workout exercises for as many sets as possible. If user is a frequent app user, they will also see their previous heaviest weight and receive weights and reps coaching from the app.
- **Mark workout completion**: Users can mark their workouts completed and see their workout ticked green in their calendar.
- **Progress tracking**: Users can view completion rate for their workout programme, a calendar view of their workout schedules, line charts of exercises user do for their progression.

## **Technologies**

- **Languages**: Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, Javascript, Stimulus, Turbo  
- **Tools and Platforms**: Heroku (for deployment), GitHub (for version control)
- **Key Gems**: 
  - `bootstrap`: For responsive UI design
  - `simple_form`: For easy form handling
  - `font-awesome-sass`: For icons
  - `sassc-rails`: For SCSS compilation
  - `simple-calendar`: For workout calendars
  - `devise`: for user registration and user session management

 ## **Bits That I Enjoyed Working on the Most**

- Working on routes for 7 data models and make them as less nested as possible.
- Working on features I wish to have for my workout app! That includes a calendar view for workout and a carousel of line charts for users' exercise progression over time.
